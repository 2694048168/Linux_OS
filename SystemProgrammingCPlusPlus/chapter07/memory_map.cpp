/** memory mapping and permissions
 * The mmap() function may be used to map memory from different sources into a program.
 * want to make device memory into your application, you would use mmap(). 
 * 
 * If MAP_ANONYMOUS is passed to mmap(), it can be used to allocate memory the 
 * same way you would allocate memory using malloc() and free(). 
 * mmap() is used to allocate a 4k page of memory that is marked read/write. 
 * 
 * The use of MAP_PRIVATE tells mmap() that you do not intend to share this memory with other applications
 * (for example, for interprocess communication).
 * 
 * Advantages: 
 * 1. Fragmentation
 * 2. Permissions(read-write-execute)
 * 3. Shared memory
 * Disadvantages:
 * 1. Performance
 * 2. Granularity
 * 
 * Permissions:
 * On systems that support read/write or read/execute
 * write and execute permissions should not be used together at the same time.(enforce W^E permissions.)
 * 
 * while still providing a means to set the desired permissions,
 * POSIX provides mprotect(),
 * which allows you to change the permissions of memory that has already been allocated.

/** Memory fragmentation
 * Memory fragmentation refers to a process in which memory is broken up into chunks, 
 * often spread out, almost always resulting in the allocator's inability to allocate memory for an application, 
 * ultimately resulting in std::bad_alloc() being thrown in C++. 
 * When programming systems, fragmentation should always be a concern as it can
 * dramatically impact the stability and reliability of your program, 
 * especially on resourceconstrained systems, such as embedded and mobile applications. 
 * 
 * There are two types of fragmentation â€” external and internal fragmentation
 * 
 * External fragmentation refers to the process by 
 * which memory is allocated and deallocated in different sized chunks, 
 * ultimately leading to large amounts of unusable, unallocatable memory. 
 * in other words, the free memory is fragmented.
 * External fragmentation, in the general case, is an extremely difficult problem to solve, 
 * and this problem has been studied for years, with operating systems implementing various approaches over time.
 * 
 * How C++ allocators can be used to address some external fragmentation issues 
 * in your program using various different custom allocator patterns
 * 
 * Internal fragmentation refers to memory being wasted during an allocation. 
 * For example, when we allocate an integer using mmap(), as we did in the preceding examples, 
 * mmap() allocates an entire page for the integer, wasting nearly 4k of memory in the process. 
 * This is known as internal fragmentation.
 * 
 * Internal over external fragmentation
 * External over internal fragmentation
