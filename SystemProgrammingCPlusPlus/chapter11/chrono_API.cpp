/** C++ time Chrono APIs
 * C++ includes the Chrono APIs which, mostly, provide C++ wrappers around the POSIX time.h APIs. 
 * For this reason, some time.h functions are still needed to provide full functionality, 
 * including the conversion to standard C strings. 
 * It should be noted that although some additions have been made in C++17 
 * (specifically floor(), ceil(), and round()), 
 * the Chrono APIs are expected to see a relatively large overhaul with the introduction of C++20, 
 * for this reason, the C++ Chrono APIs are briefly explained.

    /** Duration
     * The time_point{} type provides arithmetic to increment, decrement, and perform addition and subtraction. 
     * This arithmetic is all done using a C++ Chrono duration{}, which defines a range of time. 
     * Another way to view duration{} is that it would be theresulting abstraction of the POSIX difftime() call. 
     * In fact, the subtraction of two time_point{} types results in a duration{}.
     * 
     * Like the hour literal, 
     * C++ provides the following literals for a duration of time, which may be used for this arithmetic:
     * 1. Hour: h
     * 2. Minute: min
     * 3. Second: s
     * 4. Millisecond: ms
     * 5. Microsecond: us
     * 6. Nanosecond: ns
     * 
     * Durations have a relatively complex template structure, 
     * for defining their resolution (that is, whether a duration is in seconds, milliseconds, or hours), 
     * and can technically take on almost any resolution as a result. 
     * Although this functionality exists, C++ provides some predefined helpers for converting 
     * from one duration to another, preventing you from needing to know the inner workings of duration{}:
     * 
     * 1. std::chrono::nanoseconds
     * 2. std::chrono::microseconds
     * 3. std::chrono::milliseconds
     * 4. std::chrono::seconds
     * 5. std::chrono::minutes
     * 6. std::chrono::hours
     * 
     * Like time_point{}, a duration can also be manipulated using arithmetic.
     * 
     * comparisons are also supported
